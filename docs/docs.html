      <p>
        You look at a design, see a dozen sections that look the same but have
        different data. Would be nice to write the template once and add it
        dynamically as needed, right? This is where <b>components</b> come into
        play. <br />The word "component" in our context means a part or a member
        of the whole project. <i><b>Droplet</b></i> lets you build webpages
        based on components instead of static templates. Common parts can be
        reused, and the view is updated dynamically based on the data behind it.
        The framework handles the connection between the components and the
        templates defined by you. Updates are handled behind the scenes and you
        can focus on writing the logic. The general rules of classing HTML and
        JavaScript sure, still apply. The framework is essentially a .js file
        that will be probabbly included either directly form your .html files or
        from one of your custom .js files. Based on this, the bare minimum setup
        you need is an index.html.
      </p>
      <h2>Getting started</h2>
      At its core a component is a pair of HTML and a JavaScript class. The
      class handles the HTML as its template. It can also be considered that if
      the component is an object, then the HTML is what can be seen and the
      class encompasses the inner behavior. To initialize a component, just
      declare a class that extends the Droplet
      <i>Component</i> class and call the <i>super(...)</i> method in the
      constructor with a template. The template must be valid HTML, which may
      also contain the properties and tags supported by the framework. Also, it
      must contain a single root element.
      <p>
        In order for the framework to know about your components, you need to
        tell it which are they. Call the method <i>loadComponents(...)</i> with
        all your component classes. Finally to kick-off the show, call the
        method <i>setRoot(...)</i> with your main class (tha one that is at the
        root of your page). This will initialize the class tree starting from
        the given component and render it for the first time on screen.
        <br />
        A minimal setup would look something like this:
      </p>
      <pre class="code">
class Main extends Component {
  constructor() {
    super('&ltdiv>Main&lt/div>');
  }
}

loadComponents(Main);
setRoot(Main);</pre
      >
      <p>
        <b>Note: </b> All the components are rendered in the &ltbody> section of
        the index.html. This implies that the index page should not contain any
        html because it will get overwritten.
      </p>
      <h2>Nested components</h2>
      Component nesting is as easy as declaring the template. For each component
      a tag is generated. The generated tag consists of the component name
      transformed from camel-case to kebab-case. Ex. If we have a component
      named <i>BigRedBox</i>, the generated tag will be <i>big-red-box</i>. If
      we wish to use a component within another, we have to include its tag into
      the template of the other. It may be worth mentioning, a component can not
      have its own tag in its template or in any of its child components'
      template because this would lead to recurion. <br />
      We can set up a child component within our main component as follows:
      <pre class="code">
class Main extends Component {
  constructor() {
    super('&ltdiv>Main<b> and &ltbig-red-box/></b>&lt/div>');
  }
}

<b>class BigRedBox extends Component {
  constructor() {
    super('&ltdiv>BIG BOX&lt/div>');
  }
}</b>

loadComponents(Main, <b>BigRedBox</b>);
setRoot(Main);</pre>
      Component tags can be either self-closing or used in pair. It is
      recommended to use them as self-closing, since they can't have any
      content. Observe that all components need to be loaded but only one can be
      set as the root component.
      <h1 id="properties">Properties</h1>
      Properties ar the basis of the application structure. Through properties
      does data get to the user. Through properties does data get to one
      component to another. And through properties are components able to change
      their appearance. What the framework does is essentially linking the
      component properties to the template elements' properties. <br />
      <h2>Displaying properties in the template</h2>
      Let's say we have a number we want to display in the main component. We
      could do this with classical HTML, nothing fancy you say. True. Then let's
      add a spin to it and make it update every second or so. Still, doable from
      HTML but let's see how would it look like with Droplet.
      <pre class="code">
class Main extends Component {
  <b>counter = 0;</b>

  constructor() {
    super('&ltdiv><b>{counter}</b>&lt/div>');
    <b>setInterval(() => this.counter++, 1000);</b>
  }
}

loadComponents(Main);
setRoot(Main);</pre>
      Nice and easy. Isn't it? 🙂 <br />
      <p>
        Properties are linked to the template by the usage of curly braces
        ("<b>{</b>...<b>}</b>"). The contents of the braces are considered a
        property of the linked component. Linking is done through their name so
        they need to have the same name as defined in the component. Updates are
        handled automatically, there is no need to tellthe components explicitly
        when there is a change. Properties can also be updated asynchronously as
        the example shows.
      </p>
      Properties can be defined as simple class properties. They can be either
      primitives or objects. Primitives can be updated through assignments as
      the previous example shows. Objects however, being kept by reference, need
      reassignment in order for the template to update. <br />
      If we have an object property, we can update is as follows:
      <pre class="code">
class Main extends Component {
  <b>counter = {current: 0};</b>

  constructor() {
    super('&ltdiv><b>{counter.current}</b>&lt/div>');
    <b>setInterval(() => {
      this.counter = { 
        ...this.counter,
        current: this.counter.current + 1 
      }, 
      1000
    );</b>
  }
}

loadComponents(Main);
setRoot(Main);</pre>
      <p>
        <b>Note: </b> We suggest not using <i>camelCase</i> or
        <i>kebab-case</i> for template property names. Our suggestion is
        <i>snake_case</i>. This is due to the limitations of the html parser,
        which tarnsforms camel case into lowercase and because kebab case
        properties are not valid in javascript.
      </p>
      <h2>Getters and methods</h2>
      Say we want to display a counter but we also need another one that counts
      every secont tick only. We could use another property for it, but it may
      not be the best choice in all scenarios. In these cases we could use
      getter methods. Here is an example of a getter for the mentioned scenario:
      <pre class="code">
class Main extends Component {
  counter = 0;

  constructor() {
    super('&ltdiv><b>{counter}, {halfCounter}</b>&lt/div>');
    setInterval(() => {
      this.counter++, 
      1000
    );
  }

  <b>get halfCounter() {
    return Math.floor(this.counter / 2);
  }</b>
}

loadComponents(Main);
setRoot(Main);</pre>
      <b style="color: red;">PASSING ARGUMENTS TO METHODS</b>
      <h2>Inter-component communication</h2>
      Every now and then we need to send data between components. Because what
      is the use of a bunch of components that can not relate to each other. To
      send data between a component and one of its childen, we can use custom
      properties combined with the <i>inputs</i> property. By default each
      component has a property named <i>inputs</i>. It is an object that holds
      all the custom inputs it receives. Let's see how does it look like in an
      example.
      <pre class="code">
class Main extends Component {
  word = 'Art';

  constructor() {
    super('&ltdiv>Main {word} and &ltbig-red-box <b>thought={word}</b>/>&lt/div>');
  }
}

class BigRedBox extends Component {
  constructor() {
    super('&ltdiv>BIG BOX <b>{inputs.thought}</b>&lt/div>');
  }
}

loadComponents(Main, BigRedBox);
setRoot(Main);</pre
      >
      Notice that the child does not need to do anything, it can use the
      supplied data as-is. It can also use it in the component or transform it
      through a getter and then supply it to the view. <br />
      Also, as the example shows, the input variable name and the input name
      need not be the same. In the code example above the variable name is
      <i>word</i> in the parent component while the input used in the child is
      named <i>thought</i>.
      <p>
        Now let's see how can we send data backwards, from a child component to
        the parent.
      </p>
      <pre class="code">
class Main extends Component {
  <b>word = 'First';</b>

  constructor() {
    super('&ltdiv>Main {word} and &ltbig-red-box <b>change_word={updateWord}</b>/>&lt/div>');
  }

  <b>updateWord(newWord) {
    this.word = newWord;
  }</b>
  
}

class BigRedBox extends Component {
  constructor() {
    super('&ltdiv>BIG BOX&lt/div>');
    <b>this.inputs.change_word('Shiny');</b>
  }
}

loadComponents(Main, BigRedBox);
setRoot(Main);</pre>
      Let's see what happened there. Looks pretty similar to the parent-child
      communication we saw earlier. Actually it has the same form. The
      difference is only in <i>what</i> we send. If we need to send a property
      to a child, we send it through the inputs. If we want to get data from a
      child, we give it a method which can be called, and thus the parent
      updated from within the child. The method can also have parameters.
      <h1 id="events">Events</h1>
      We already saw how the template can be updated from the code, the other
      side of the coin is passing data from the template to the component. If we
      want to handle events like click or an input change, we need to bind a
      method to the change. We could do it this way:
      <pre class="code">
class Main extends Component {
  <b>word = 'honey';</b>

  constructor() {
    super('&ltdiv>
      <b>&ltp>{word}&lt/p>
      &ltinput type="text" onchange="{updateWord}" /></b>
    &lt/div>');
  }

  <b>updateWord(event) {
    this.word = event.target.value;
  }</b>
}

loadComponents(Main);
setRoot(Main);</pre>
      <h1 id="ifcase">IF case</h1>
      In case you need an if case -no word play intended 😏- we've got you
      covered. Talking about showing parts of the template conditionally. With a
      custom property named <i>*if</i> you can dynamically hide or show elements
      of the view. For the sake of example, let's toggle a div element based on
      component property.
      <pre class="code">
class Main extends Component {
  <b>isVisible = false;</b>

  constructor() {
    super('&ltdiv>
      <b>&ltspan *if="isVisible">I can see you!&lt/span></b>
    &lt/div>');
    <b>setInterval(() => (this.isVisible = !this.isVisible), 1000);</b>
  }
}

loadComponents(Main);
setRoot(Main);</pre>
      As you can see, the <i>*if</i> attribute is similar to the custom tag
      properties, differing only through the asterisk in front of it. We can
      observe also, that there is no curly braces around the passed variable.
      This is because the <i>*if</i> property supports only variable inputs and
      thus, the value passed in is automatically considered a variable. This
      special behavior applies only to two tag properties: the <i>*if</i> and
      the <i>*for</i>. <br />
      Also worth mentioning, the <i>*if</i> should be placed only on standard
      HTML elements and not custom components. If components' visibility needs
      to be changed dynamically, they can be wrapped in a HTML element on which
      the <i>*if</i> property is applied. This will produce the desired effect
      of hiding or showing the component on demand. Also worth mentioning
      related to components, they are hidden and not destroyed. This means that
      async methods within them are still active and may function internally. A
      simple example may illustrate this behavior more clearly:
      <pre class="code">
class Main extends Component {
  <b>isVisible = true;</b>

  constructor() {
    super('&ltdiv>
      <b>&ltspan *if="isVisible">
        &ltbig-red-box/>
      &lt/span></b>
    &lt/div>');
    <b>setInterval(() => this.isVisible = !this.isVisible, 1000);</b>
  }
  
}

class BigRedBox extends Component {
  <b>counter = 0;</b>

  constructor() {
    super('&ltdiv>BIG BOX <b>{counter}</b>&lt/div>');
    <b>setInterval(() => this.counter++, 500);</b>
  }
}

loadComponents(Main, BigRedBox);
setRoot(Main);</pre>
      In the example above the component's visibility is toggled on and off
      every second. The child component also has a counter within, which is
      updated twice a second. If you try it out, you can see that after
      dissapearing and reappearing, the counter will not continue from where it
      left off before dissapearing. It will count indifferently of the
      component's visibility.
      <h1 id="forloop">FOR loop</h1>
      Imagine the scenario where you have a list of elements on your page, all
      differing only by some properties, but essentially the same. Let's say you
      have a hundred such elements. What do you do? Exactly for these scenarios
      we have the custom property <i>*for</i>. Let's take a simple example. We
      have a list of names and want to display them in some kind of container.
      <pre class="code">
class Main extends Component {
  <b>names = ['Anne', 'Billy', 'Charlotte', 'Dan'];</b>

  constructor() {
    super('&ltdiv>
      <b>&ltspan *for="name of names">
        &ltbig-red-box name={name}/>
      &lt/span></b>
    &lt/div>');
  }
  
}

class BigRedBox extends Component {
  constructor() {
    super('&ltdiv>BIG BOX <b>{inputs.name}</b>&lt/div>');
  }
}

loadComponents(Main, BigRedBox);
setRoot(Main);</pre>
      In the example we take the <i>names</i> list and pass it to the
      <i>*for</i> property. In order to iterate the items, we need to use the
      syntax: <i>*for="element of elements"</i>. We can access then the
      <i>element</i> from all the tags within the one with <i>*for</i>. <br />
      Similar to the <i>*if</i> property, the <i>*for</i> should be placed only
      on standard HTML elements and not custom components. If components need to
      be generated dynamically, they can be wrapped in a HTML element on which
      the <i>*for</i> property is applied. Keep in mind that arrays are objects
      in javascript, therefore if we simply edit their elements their reference
      stays the same. If we want to add or remove elements, we need to update
      the reference too. The example below shows a possible way to add a name
      from an input and to remove the given name from the list.
      <pre class="code">
class Main extends Component {
  <b>currentName = '';
  names = ['Anne', 'Billy', 'Charlotte', 'Dan'];</b>

  constructor() {
    super('&ltdiv>
      <b>&ltp>
        Name: &ltinput type="text" onchange="{setCurrentName}" />
        &ltbutton onclick="{addName}">Add&lt/button>
        &ltbutton onclick="{removeName}">Remove&lt/button>
      &lt/p>
      &ltspan *for="name of names">
        &ltbig-red-box name={name}/>
      &lt/span></b>
    &lt/div>');
  }

  <b>setCurrentName(event) {
    this.currentName = event.target.value;
  }

  addName() {
    this.names = [...this.names, this.currentName];
  }

  removeName() {
    this.names = this.names.filter((name) => name !== this.currentName);
  }</b>

}

class BigRedBox extends Component {
  constructor() {
    super('&ltdiv>BIG BOX {inputs.name}&lt/div>');
  }
}

loadComponents(Main, BigRedBox);
setRoot(Main);</pre>
